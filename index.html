    <h2> What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines
    capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep
    learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.<br>

    <h3> How is AI used?</h3>
    <h4>Narrow AI:</h4>
    Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a
    simulation of human intelligence.<br>
    Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent,
    they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence. <br>

    <h4>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</h4> AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial
    intelligence we see in the movies,like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next
    Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any
    problem.<br>
